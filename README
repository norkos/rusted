BUILDING
Rusted is using plain make as a build system. To see list of the targets, just type "make" or "make help".
You will find all nessesary libraries in Ubuntu repositories.


TESTING
There are two scripts which will execute previously built tests: run_sct.sh and run_tests.sh.
run_tests.sh runs everything which is an automated test. run_sct.sh will run ServerSCT tests.


RUNNING A GAME
You can run test versions of server and client. There are two scripts to do that:

    _build/runTestServer
    _build/runTestClient

Server/TestDataBase.xml is the world database which will be used in the test session.
